# About Us

Rolling With Advantage is dedicated to helping kids in the juvenile justice system build skills and have fun through pen and paper role playing games. Our goal is to give kids a second chance through games and equip them with the skills needed for successful re-entry into the community. The service is free, and experienced game masters volunteer their time and skills. 

Evidence shows games help players reduce stress and increase cognitive skills. Pen and paper role playing games are shown to be great behavioral therapy tools for many reasons. P&P RPGs are a creative outlet with an immediate reward and no special skills required to start. They are low-cost, low-risk, and they build a range of skills, including:

* improvisation
* team-building
* problem-solving 
* storytelling
* cooperation
* social skills building
* planning and strategy
* arithmetic & math
* leadership

The name of our organization is inspired by the Dungeons & Dragons, 5th Edition rule where players with "advantage" can roll twice instead of the one roll they’re normally allowed and take the roll with the higher value. We exist to provide a second chance to youth in the juvenile justice system. 

# FAQ:

**What’s a pen-and-paper role playing game?**  
A pen-and-paper role playing game (RPG), also called a tabletop or table-talk RPG, is a type of game in which the participants describe their actions through speech and act according to a set of rules, with plenty of room to improvise. In most games, a designated game master (GM) creates the setting, manages the game, and enforces the rules. The outcome of the game can be influenced by the players’ actions, the framework of the game, and the executive decisions of the GM. There are many types of popular pen-and-paper RPGs, including Dungeons & Dragons, Starwars, Pathfinder, and Shadow Run. Many educators find RPGs to be a healthy way for learners to practice reading and arithmetic skills. 

**What do you need to play a pen-and-paper RPG?** 
You need: 
* players
* a game master (GM)
* pen and paper 
* dice of different kinds, depending on the game, usually costing less than $1.00 

That’s it! No, really. It’s often useful to have the game’s rulebook, but RWA GMs will bring rule books with them as needed.
